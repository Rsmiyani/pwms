## Installation

### Prerequisites

- **PHP** >= 7.4
- **MySQL** >= 5.7
- **Apache** with `mod_rewrite` enabled
- **XAMPP** / **WAMP** / **LAMP** or any PHP-capable web server

### Steps

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Rsmiyani/pwms.git
   ```

2. **Move to your web server directory**
   ```bash
   # For XAMPP on Windows:
   mv pwms C:\xampp\htdocs\Party-worker

   # For LAMP on Linux:
   mv pwms /var/www/html/Party-worker
   ```

3. **Create the database**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p -e "CREATE DATABASE pwms CHARACTER SET utf8mb4 COLLATE utf8mb4_unicode_ci;"
   ```

4. **Import the schema and sample data**
   ```bash
   mysql -u root -p pwms < database/setup.sql
   ```

5. **Configure the application** — edit `config/db.php`:
   ```php
   define('DB_HOST', 'localhost');
   define('DB_USER', 'root');
   define('DB_PASS', '');
   define('DB_NAME', 'pwms');

   // Set BASE_URL based on your setup:
   // Root deployment:        define('BASE_URL', '');
   // Subdirectory (XAMPP):   define('BASE_URL', '/Party-worker');
   ```

6. **Set upload directory permissions** (Linux/Mac):
   ```bash
   chmod 755 uploads/proofs/
   ```

7. **Open in browser**
   ```
   http://localhost/Party-worker/
   ```
